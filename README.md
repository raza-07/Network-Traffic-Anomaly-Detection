# Network-Traffic-Anomaly-Detection
The Gaussian distribution-based anomaly detection method for network traffic data is used to get complex data anomalies.  The aim is to find odd patterns and departures from network communication's typical behaviour. The steps that comprise the approach are identifying pertinent attributes, normalising the data, estimating Gaussian distribution parameters, computing anomaly scores, and establishing an anomalous detection threshold. A scatter plot is used to display the data, highlighting the differences between aberrant and normal network activity.
